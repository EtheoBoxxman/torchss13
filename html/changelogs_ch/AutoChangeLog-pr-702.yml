  - rscdel: "Removed the lazy engineer note as no longer relevant"
  - rscdel: "Removed some excess and unused cables"
  - qol: "Removed excess and broken wiring prefabs from the map for ease of future mapping"
  - bugfix: "Fixes incorrectly wired powernet sensors"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the incorrectly wired grid checker"
  - bugfix: "Added some missing atmos pipes"
  - bugfix: "Renamed the solars RCON tag at the main base to no longer be named as \"Expedition Outpost Solars\""
  - bugfix: "Added missing cable on engineering substation"

  - bugfix: "Replace the outpost mining SMES with a buildable SMES"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some incorrectly wired subgrid breakers"
  - bugfix: "Redirected solars to mains grid"
  - maptweak: "Reworked engine wiring to not be hotwired to the grid - input to be controlled by a renamed Input SMES initially set at low output to conserve power when there's no roundstart engineer"
  - maptweak: "Replaced the R-UST's walls with reinforced lead for better radiation protection. Also re-bound and replaced some oddly located shutters to be more in line with the other reactor shutters, to be controlled from the reactor control room."
  - maptweak: "Altering the paths of some cables and pipes to attempt to avoid pulling them up stairs or through floors where possible (apartments and some other places left untouched for now because... it would be too difficult to do so without ruining the look of the apartments I feel)"
  - maptweak: "Recoloured cables to be consistent throughout the station for ease of grid troubleshooting, management and expansion. Red and heavy duty cables are the mains/master grid. Green cables are the department subgrids. Yellow cables are engine output. Cyan cables are engine input/tcomms."
  - maptweak: "AI SMES connected to mains grid instead of sec grid"

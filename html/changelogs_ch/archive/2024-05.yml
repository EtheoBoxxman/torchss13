      when there's no roundstart engineer
  - maptweak: Replaced the R-UST's walls with reinforced lead for better radiation
      protection. Also re-bound and replaced some oddly located shutters to be more
      in line with the other reactor shutters, to be controlled from the reactor control
      room.
  - maptweak: Altering the paths of some cables and pipes to attempt to avoid pulling
      them up stairs or through floors where possible (apartments and some other places
      left untouched for now because... it would be too difficult to do so without
      ruining the look of the apartments I feel)
  - maptweak: Recoloured cables to be consistent throughout the station for ease of
      grid troubleshooting, management and expansion. Red and heavy duty cables are
      the mains/master grid. Green cables are the department subgrids. Yellow cables

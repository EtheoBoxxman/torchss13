  - rscadd: Adds powernet sensors to grids that were previously missing them
  - rscdel: Removed the lazy engineer note as no longer relevant
  - rscdel: Removed some excess and unused cables

      mapping
  - bugfix: Fixes incorrectly wired powernet sensors
  - bugfix: Fixed the incorrectly wired grid checker

  - bugfix: Fixed some incorrectly wired subgrid breakers
  - bugfix: Redirected solars to mains grid
  - maptweak: Reworked engine wiring to not be hotwired to the grid - input to be
      controlled by a renamed Input SMES initially set at low output to conserve power
      when there's no roundstart engineer
  - maptweak: Replaced the R-UST's walls with reinforced lead for better radiation
      protection. Also re-bound and replaced some oddly located shutters to be more
      in line with the other reactor shutters, to be controlled from the reactor control
      room.
  - maptweak: Altering the paths of some cables and pipes to attempt to avoid pulling
      them up stairs or through floors where possible (apartments and some other places
      left untouched for now because... it would be too difficult to do so without
      ruining the look of the apartments I feel)
  - maptweak: Recoloured cables to be consistent throughout the station for ease of
      grid troubleshooting, management and expansion. Red and heavy duty cables are
      the mains/master grid. Green cables are the department subgrids. Yellow cables
      are engine output. Cyan cables are engine input/tcomms.
  - maptweak: AI SMES connected to mains grid instead of sec grid

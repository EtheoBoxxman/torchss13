  VoRe-bot:
  - bugfix: Old laser4 moved to modular_chomp to prevent conflict issues, and references
      to this sound file altered accordingly
  - bugfix: Corrected a misplaced chompedit that removed code necessary for cyborgs
      to navigate in space.
  - bugfix: fucky filename fix maybe finally
  - rscadd: 'Added new illegal item for handheld Item TF: Mind Binder'
  - rscadd: Sentient items digested in a belly with recycling now become the recycled
      matter
  - refactor: Gentle phasing flicker duration from 3s to 1s
  - refactor: Gentle phasing defaults on.
  - refactor: Gentle phasing stun reduced from 3s to 1s
  - rscadd: Goodies for alternative titles
  - balance: Rebalanced some of the goodie lists
  - balance: Surgery speed has been massively buffed.
  - rscadd: Cinnamon seeds added to the seed storages in garden and xenobotany
  - rscadd: Added emergency shutters that were missing on the south part of deck 1
  - rscdel: Removed two shutter doors in the dorms corridor that were cutting off
      certain areas from a scrubber or a pump when closed due to an alarm
  - qol: Moved a space heater that was blocking a trash pile
  - bugfix: Fixed the airlock on the Ninja shuttle so the airlock helper doesn't panic
      when loading up the round. Also moved the button so that it doesn't get left
      behind when the shuttle jumps (not that it gets used)
  - balance: Removed the random EVA 'slipping' chance. This contributed nothing besides
      making spacewalks without magboots incredibly annoying.
  - balance: The 'thunk' proc (walking onto a gravity tile from zero gravity) now
      only stuns you for 1 tick (around one second or less) and no longer weakens
      you. This'll cause you to drop what you're holding but otherwise it's only a
      brief, mild disruption for not using magboots or walk intenting onto a tile
      with gravity.
  - bugfix: removed a sound file for a quick fix
  - bugfix: '"Transfer to Shell" AI verb'
  - rscadd: Added new standalone exploration vendors for each of the roles with standardized
      equipment. Not mapped in as of this update, but available for gamemasters to
      use.
  - rscadd: Added tinyfans to the 25x25 'Diner' shelter.
  - qol: Significantly reduced use delays on all pouches.
  - balance: Fultons per pack have been reduced from 5 uses to 3 uses.
  - balance: Mech shoes can now hold knives.
  - balance: Flares and glowsticks are now one size smaller. Flare boxes now contain
      14 flares instead of 4.
  - balance: Flare pouches can now hold 14 flares.
  - balance: Removed guaranteed stun and weaken statuses from the 'magnetic' weapon
      parent type.
  - balance: Regular synthetics are now immune to welders.
  - bugfix: Fixed missing icon for mech shoes.

  VoRe-bot:
  - bugfix: Old laser4 moved to modular_chomp to prevent conflict issues, and references
      to this sound file altered accordingly
  - bugfix: Corrected a misplaced chompedit that removed code necessary for cyborgs
      to navigate in space.
  - bugfix: fucky filename fix maybe finally
  - rscadd: 'Added new illegal item for handheld Item TF: Mind Binder'
  - rscadd: Sentient items digested in a belly with recycling now become the recycled
      matter

  - rscdel: Removed two shutter doors in the dorms corridor that were cutting off
      certain areas from a scrubber or a pump when closed due to an alarm
  - qol: Moved a space heater that was blocking a trash pile
  - bugfix: Fixed the airlock on the Ninja shuttle so the airlock helper doesn't panic
      when loading up the round. Also moved the button so that it doesn't get left
      behind when the shuttle jumps (not that it gets used)
  - balance: Removed the random EVA 'slipping' chance. This contributed nothing besides
      making spacewalks without magboots incredibly annoying.
  - balance: The 'thunk' proc (walking onto a gravity tile from zero gravity) now
      only stuns you for 1 tick (around one second or less) and no longer weakens
      you. This'll cause you to drop what you're holding but otherwise it's only a
      brief, mild disruption for not using magboots or walk intenting onto a tile
      with gravity.
  - bugfix: removed a sound file for a quick fix
  - bugfix: '"Transfer to Shell" AI verb'

      equipment. Not mapped in as of this update, but available for gamemasters to
      use.

      14 flares instead of 4.
  - balance: Flare pouches can now hold 14 flares.

      parent type.
  - balance: Regular synthetics are now immune to welders.

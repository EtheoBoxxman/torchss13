  VoRe-bot:
  - rscadd: Added synth emotes to corrupt hounds and subtypes. *roboboop
  - rscadd: Added a maw belly to leopardmanders that autotransfers to their gut. Dunno
      what made me do that (especially since it ended up being a lot of trouble to
      get working properly)
  - rscadd: Added a whole new AI to swoopies based on nurse spiders looking for items
      to wrap. Right click an AI controlled swoopie and choose the "Change Settings"
      verb to tell the swoopie to swoop stuff!
  - rscadd: Added wrappers dropping in vorebellies if you eat and digest the whole
      food item.
  - rscadd: Added bones to merc and other humanoid corpses. (leave remains pref is
      now enabled for them!)
  - qol: Made vac-packs not ask if you want to set the destination to borg belly if
      you're not a borg
  - bugfix: Fixed throwing mobs into disposal bins. For some reason it was implemented
      but in a very shitty way that only checked for micro holders. It should work
      properly. No autoflush :(
  - image: added the secondary belly layer to the original set of vore bellies. Somehow
      we missed those and virgo had them. Now we should both have them!
  - bugfix: some hairstyles not showing
  - bugfix: new meka borg sprite not usable
  - rscadd: hlscream
  - rscadd: hlpain emote

  - bugfix: UpdatePaths script will now also update maps inside the modular_chomp

  - rscadd: Properly implemented clear gas masks
  - rscadd: Readded the original gasmask icon
  - rscadd: added both clear and not clear gasmasks to loadout for 3 points. Happy
      tiding!
  - rscadd: replaced the normal gas masks in biohazard lockers with clear ones
  - rscadd: secretly adds on-mob icons for mouth-held grenades for teshari because
      I was bored
  - rscdel: Removed the `obj/item/clothing/mask/gas/wwii` subtype of the mask since
      the base subtype fills it's role.
  - qol: Makes greytide AI carbon mobs have a bit more variation.
  - image: Added all of the mob_vr_mask.dmi and associated species files to the modularity
      folder
  - code_imp: Removed the check for base gas masks to remove their face-consealing
      abilities because they're no longer clear. Subtypes that are clear can now just
      use the /clear subtype since it's properly in now
  - rscadd: Southern Cross has new maints on floor 3 and 2. Viro, genetics and autorelseeving
      are now upon floor 1
